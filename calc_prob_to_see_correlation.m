% calc_probabilitiesToSee computes probabilities to see partner choice for
% the two players given their reaction times (RT). For this RT difference
% is computed and then mapped to [0,1] interval by means of logistic curve
%
% INPUT
%   - reactionTime - 2xN array of players reaction times in ms 
%   - isOwnChoice - 2xN array where players own choices are indicated by 1 
%   - windowSize - window size for averaging 
% OUTPUT:
%   - corrCoefValue, corrPValue - correlations and p-Values for reactionTime and isOwnChoice
%   - corrCoefAveraged, corrPValueAveraged - correlations and p-Values for 
%        reactionTime and isOwnChoice running-averaged over windowSize
% EXAMPLE of use
