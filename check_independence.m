% check_independence tests whether there is a coordination between two players 
% or if they are making choices ignoring each other 
%
% INPUT
%   - isOwnChoice - 2xN array of booleans 
%     isOwnChoice(i,j) = 1 indicated that player i at trial j selected own target;
%   - sideChoice - 2xN array of booleans 
%     sideChoice(i,j) = 1 indicated that player i at trial j selected side 1;
%
% OUTPUT:
%   - sideChoiceIndependence - pValue for independence of side choices of two players;
%   - partnerInluenceOnTarget - pValue for independence of target choices of two players;
%
%   if sideChoiceIndependence < alpha and partnerInluenceOnTarget < alpha
%   then choices of players are most likely not independent
