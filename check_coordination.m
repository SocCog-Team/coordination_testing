% check_coordination tests whether there is a coordination between two players 
% or if they are making choices ignoring each other

% INPUT
%   - isOwnChoice - 2xN array of booleans 
%     isOwnChoice(i,j) = 1 indicated that player i at trial j selected own target;

%     sideChoice(i,j) = 1 indicated that player i at trial j selected side 1;

% OUTPUT:
%   - partnerInluenceOnSide - 2-element vector indicating whether the choice
%     of side for player i is influenced by partner choices;
%   - partnerInluenceOnTarget - 2-element vector indicating whether the choice
%     of target for player i is influenced by partner choices;
%
%   if partnerInluenceOnSide(i) == partnerInluenceOnTarget(i) == 1 then
%   the choices of player i are most likely not independent on the choices
